PCA-based Classification of Digits from Images
This repository contains code for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on digit images and using the reduced data for classification tasks.

Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Preprocess digit image data.
Perform PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
Train a classifier (e.g., SVM, logistic regression) on the PCA-transformed data.
Evaluate the classifier's performance.
